1. Feed lent
2. Friendship: friend list and friends Notes
3. Messaging?
4. Comments -- DONE!
5. Profile page -- DONE!
6. Bootstrap
7. Maybe refactor profile pages: collect profile and another_profile in a one view function with condition authentificated/unauthentificated
8. Post-page with all comments or pagination
9. Deleting posts (with comments) and comments separately
